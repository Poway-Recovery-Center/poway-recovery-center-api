# Poway Recovery Center API

Flask backend for user accounts on the [Poway Recovery Center site](https://github.com/AdyaShipekar/poway-recovery-center). This is the same split as the Open Coding Society [pages](https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/pages) (frontend) and [flask](https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/flask) (backend) repos.

## Run locally
```bash
make            # creates .venv, installs requirements, starts the API on http://localhost:8587
make stop       # stops it
```
Then run `make` in the poway-recovery-center repo and visit `http://localhost:4000`.

To run it by hand:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py      # creates instance/volumes/user_management.db and starts the API
```

## Structure
- `main.py`: entry point; registers the API, creates the database and default users, runs the server
- `__init__.py`: Flask `app`, CORS (allowed frontend origins), settings, and `db`
- `model/user.py`: `User` model and `initUsers()` default users
- `api/jwt_authorize.py`: `@token_required` JWT cookie guard
- `api/user.py`: REST API for sign up, log in/out, profile, admin user list
- `model/schedule.py`: `Meeting` and `Booking` models; `sync_meetings()` pulls the center's real weekly meetings from the live feed
- `api/schedule.py`: REST API for the meeting calendar and spot reservations
- `model/contact.py`, `api/contact.py`: messages from the Contact Us form (admins read them on their profile page)
- `api/chat.py`: support assistant; forwards the site chatbot to Google Gemini using `GEMINI_API_KEY` from `.env`, falling back to Groq (`GROQ_API_KEY`)
- `.env`: secret key and passwords (not committed)
- `instance/volumes/user_management.db`: SQLite database (users, meetings, bookings, contact messages; created on first run, not committed)
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`: production server (gunicorn on port 8587)

### Accounts
`initUsers()` creates these users when the API starts (the list is `MEMBERS` in `__init__.py`). Existing users keep their password and profile; only their role is updated to match the list.

| Name | Username | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adya Shipekar | `adyashipekar` (or adya.shipekar1@gmail.com) | Admin |
| Anika Seksaria | `anikaseksaria` | Admin |
| Jailene Tang | `jailenetang` | Admin |
| Joan Kim | `joankim` | User |
| Ainsley Albert | `ainsleyalbert` | User |
| Samanvi Yachareni | `samanviyachareni` | User |

Starting passwords come from `.env`: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` for the site admin and `<FIRSTNAME>_PASSWORD` for each member (e.g. `JOAN_PASSWORD`). Anyone can change their password, email, and phone number from their profile page.

## API
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/authenticate` | Log in `{uid, password}` (uid can be the username or email); sets an httpOnly JWT cookie |
| DELETE | `/api/authenticate` | Log out |
| GET | `/api/id` | Current user's profile |
| POST | `/api/user` | Sign up `{name, uid, email?, phone?, password}` and log in |
| PUT | `/api/user` | Update `{name, email, phone}` and/or `{current_password, new_password}` |
| GET | `/api/user` | Admin only: list every user |
| DELETE | `/api/user` | Admin only: delete a user `{uid}` |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Support assistant `{messages: [{role: "user"\|"model", text}]}` → `{reply}` (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`; optional `GEMINI_MODEL`; backup `GROQ_API_KEY`, optional `GROQ_MODEL`, default `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) |
| POST | `/api/contact` | Contact Us form `{name, message, topic?, email?, phone?}` (anyone) |
| GET | `/api/contact` | Admin only: every contact message, newest first |
| PUT | `/api/contact` | Admin only: mark a message handled `{id, handled}` |
| GET | `/api/contact/topics` | Topics offered in the form |
| GET | `/api/schedule?start=YYYY-MM-DD&days=7` | Calendar: each day from `start` (default today, Poway time) for `days` (max 42) with its sessions, spots left, and `booked_by_me` when logged in |
| GET | `/api/schedule/meetings` | The weekly recurring meeting list |
| PUT | `/api/schedule/meetings` | Admin only: set spots per session `{id, capacity}` |
| GET | `/api/schedule/bookings` | Current user's upcoming reservations |
| POST | `/api/schedule/bookings` | Reserve spots `{meeting_id, date, spots?}` (default 1) |
| PUT | `/api/schedule/bookings` | Change how many spots your reservation holds `{meeting_id, date, spots}` |
| DELETE | `/api/schedule/bookings` | Cancel a reservation `{meeting_id, date}` |
| POST | `/api/schedule/sync` | Admin only: re-sync meetings from the feed now |

### Meeting schedule
The schedule is the real list of meetings held at Poway Recovery Center (13939 Poway Rd). Nothing is hard-coded: on start, and again every `SCHEDULE_REFRESH_SECONDS` (default 6 hours) when the calendar is read, the API downloads the [North County San Diego AA](https://ncsandiegoaa.org/meetings/) meeting feed (`SCHEDULE_FEED_URL`), keeps meetings whose location is "Poway Recovery Center" or whose address is 13939 Poway Rd, and updates the `meetings` table. Meetings dropped from the feed are marked inactive. If the feed can't be reached, the last synced schedule stays in use. "Today" and the calendar days follow Poway time (America/Los_Angeles).

Each session starts with `SCHEDULE_DEFAULT_CAPACITY` spots (default 20). Admins can change that per meeting, and syncs never overwrite it. One person can hold up to `SCHEDULE_MAX_SPOTS_PER_USER` spots per meeting (default 5), for example to bring family. Reservations open `SCHEDULE_BOOKING_DAYS` ahead (default 30) and close when the meeting starts.

## Deploying
Deploy it like Open Coding Society flask, on a server with Docker:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdyaShipekar/poway-recovery-center-api.git
cd poway-recovery-center-api
cp /path/to/your/.env .env     # SECRET_KEY, ADMIN_PASSWORD, member passwords, IS_PRODUCTION=true
docker compose up -d --build   # serves the API on port 8587; database is kept in instance/
```
Put it behind HTTPS (e.g. nginx + certbot, as in OCS `nginx_flask_8587.conf`). `IS_PRODUCTION=true` is required there: the frontend is on a different domain (github.io), so the login cookie must be `SameSite=None; Secure`.

Then set that https address as `deployedPythonURI` in the frontend's `js/api/config.js`. `https://adyashipekar.github.io` is already an allowed CORS origin. Add any other frontend address to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`.
